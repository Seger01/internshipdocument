\subsection{Project}
\label{project-background}

%Review: This shouls not include the aim of the project just the background and history

The Stewart platform development is a umbrella project to experiment with
different embedded software and FPGA firmware implementation strategies. This project was started to 
test alternative implementation approaches, finding the balance between
implementation choice, design complexity, integration effort and cost. The
development of the Stewart platform is driven by a series of graduation projects,
increasing the (software) complexity step-by-step. The history of the project
can be summarized as: 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item[] \textbf{Mitchell Broeren} Was
        responsible for creating the physical platform implementation: the mechanical
        aspects as well as the first driver implementation. He had to overcome all the
        aspects involved building a design from scratch. Delivered a working platform
        with some needs for improvement.
    \item[]\textbf{Chiel van de
        Camp} Improved the motor drive quality and processing model. Also introduced the
        touch-screen balance board as pressure sensor. Demonstrated that proper
        balancing act with the board and a ball was reliable possible. And also
        demonstrated that the pressure sensor may not be the most optimal choice.
    \item[]\textbf{Jesper Weijnen} Changed the inverse kinetic model implementation
        of the Stewart platform into a look-up table in the context of improving on
        latency of the control flow using the microcontroller. The idea of the balancing
        board was replaced by an object tracking implementation, where the platform
        should keep the object to track in the middle of the screen. Object recognition
        was introduced using a USB webcam on a PC\@. The experiment clearly illustrated
        that real-time video processing performance requires dedicated processing
        hardware, unless serious compromises are made or very application specific
        optimizations are considered. An experiment to get the video processing
        implemented in the FPGA using high-level-synthesis (C-code synthesis straight
        into FPGA logic) was also successful but could not be tested live due to a
        limitation in time. 
    \item[]\textbf{Stef van Stipdonk} Has created a specific
        skeleton VWC BSP to have multiple development kits collaborate. The user
        interface to interact with the devices runs over a webserver. Both functions
shall be re-used when extending the demonstrator platform. \end{itemize}
\subsection{Parties}

This project is developed and executed as a graduation internship assignment.
The two primary parties involved in this project are:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item \textbf{Avans Hogeschool:} The educational institution
        providing the internship program. Avans Hogeschool is responsible for overseeing
        the interns' progress, providing educational support, and consulting on academic
        matters. Additionally, an educational consultant from Avans Hogeschool is
        involved to ensure that the internship aligns with the educational requirements
        and the students' learning outcomes. 
    \item \textbf{Topic Embedded Systems:} The
        company providing the internship assignment and the consultancy during the
        project. Topic Embedded Systems is responsible for offering the project topic,
        guidance, and technical consultancy. The company also evaluates the interns'
        progress, providing real-world experience in embedded systems development and
        professional development. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Result (Wouter)}


\subsection{Problem Analysis} As described in section \ref{project-background},
the current version of the project is a functional Stewart platform that uses a
touchpad sensor to determine the ball's position. The system is controlled by an
STM32 microcontroller, which utilizes an inverse kinematics lookup table to
operate the motors via motor drivers.

However, the touchpad sensor introduces significant latency, which negatively
impacts the systemâ€™s responsiveness and performance. This limitation affects the
accuracy and real-time capabilities of the platform. Topic has researched the
possibility of replacing the touchpad with a camera-based machine vision system
to reduce latency and improve tracking precision.

Additionally, there is a need to migrate the current demonstration setup from
the STM32 microcontroller to the Miami Plus ZU9 board.
the project will explore communication options between the CPU and the FPGA,
particularly through the built-in DMA module, to optimize data transfer.

\subsection{Problem Definition} 
%Review: formal english so no contractions like ball's and the entire sentence it is in does not read well because of the large amount of comma's
%Review2: This entire subsection does not really include a problem definition, it is more of a continuation of the problem analysis or project ojective

To enhance the current setup, this project will
integrate a previously selected camera to detect the ball's position, speed, and
direction, improving platform control. Additionally, the existing STM32-based
implementation is migrated to the Miami Plus ZU9 board. In this new
configuration, the FPGA will serve as the primary controller for machine vision
processing and as the interface between the board and the motor controllers.

These functionalities must be integrated and managed by a custom
Linux distribution, which will combine the various components and enable
demonstration management via a web interface.

\subsection{Objective}
The Objective of this project is to gain more knowledge about machine vision and motor control using the FPGA 
and to improve the current setup to reduce latency and improve overall performance.
\subsection{Final Result}
The final result of this project is a functional stewards platform using the Miami Plus ZU9.
Where the FPGA is used to

\subsection{Risk Mitigation Plan}
To effectively manage the identified risks, the following mitigation plan will be implemented:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Regular Monitoring:} Risks will be reviewed and updated regularly during team meetings and progress reviews.
    \item \textbf{Contingency Planning:} For high-priority risks, contingency plans will be developed and documented.
    \item \textbf{Communication:} Any new risks or changes to existing risks will be communicated to all stakeholders promptly.
    \item \textbf{Documentation:} All risks, mitigation strategies, and outcomes will be documented for future reference and continuous improvement.
\end{itemize}
